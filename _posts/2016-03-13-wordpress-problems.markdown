For the past couple of months I've been having a lot of serious problems with WordPress. To the point of having to completely wipe them out and start over. Malware can be planted on a site without any knowledge of it even happening.

So we are switching to a safer solution for websites and we will now be using Jekyll. Jekyll is website software that can be used for blogging. It is a simple software and doesn't have a lot of moving parts. For example there is no database. And with no database it's not very hackable.   

Hackers use MySQL injections to infect sites. MySQL injections are database queries that the hacker can use to gain access to your site.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
