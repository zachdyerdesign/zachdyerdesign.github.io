With 2016 whizzing fast towards its end, the excitement in the air is almost palpable. Of course, we would want to bid the year a good farewell, and what better to start the new year than giving your business a boost in sales with your website.

There is no better or more cost effective way to advertise your business than on the World Wide Web. If done correctly Web pages make your business, company or organization easily accessible to anyone with a PC, laptop, Tablet or mobile phone

There could be many decisions that go into updating your website and we have broken down our 14 key reasons into four categories: Design, Marketing, Usability and Time.

### Design

When people visit your site, they see it as a reflection of your organisation. If your site looks professional and is loaded with useful information readers will see you as an authority and expert. Likewise if the site looks poorly designed and structured and/or out-of-date they’ll make the same assumptions about your company. The website should highlight your product and/or service and the layout should look harmonious and consistent.

Has your content got dates on it – blog posts, events and similar? It makes sense to remove or update out of date content. As websites mature and grow, it often becomes apparent that certain parts just aren’t working well anymore and are becoming outdated. An obvious example of this is the use of flash.

### Marketing

Many dated websites lack effective calls to actions that convert users to customers. A call-to-action (CTA) is a button or link that you place on your website to drive prospective customers to become leads by completing an action on your landing page. Is your USP and call to actions highlighted clearly on every landing page? As important, are they interesting enough to persuade your visitor to complete the desired action?

### Usability

When we talk about user experience (UX), we are referring to the totality of visitors’ experience with your site—more than just how it looks, UX includes how easy your site is to use, how fast it is, how easy it is to find information and how little friction there is when visitors try to complete whatever action it is they’re trying to complete. You website navigation should focus on nudging the right visitor toward the must-have experience.

### Time

Keeping fresh content on the site gives your customers a reason to come back by having a blog on your website similar to this website. Also it helps with your search engine rankings because Google will take into account new content when your website is crawled.
