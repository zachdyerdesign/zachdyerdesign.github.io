title: Why web programmers should ditch Wordpress
author: Zach Dyer

Wordpress is one of the most popular content management systems available for
websites for many reasons. It is open sourced software and it is free to use for
any for personal or business purposes. It runs on cheap Linux based servers and
quick and easy to install. It has a plugin for almost anything you could imagine.

However, hackers know almost every site on the internet is a Wordpress site so it
is a prime target for hackers in the same way Windows is targeted over Linux and
Mac OS for hackers. Also with 152,000 video's on youtube on 'how to hack wordpress'
it's easy for any script kitty to figure out how to hack it. Wordpress has many
different entry points for hackers.

Wordpress uses a database to store data for
the website content, plugins, and themes and SQL injections can be used to gain
access and take control of a Wordpress site. Anyone can write a plugin and
publish it to the Wordpress plugin directory that any Wordpress Admin can
download and use without even realizing it's a hacked plugin. According to
[Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/03/attackers-gain-access-wordpress-sites/)
almost 60% of hacks are through Wordpress plugins.

I used to use Wordpress for most of my clients, but when they started getting
hacked I had to move wipe them and move them to new servers. And now most of the
sites I build now are static sites. They don't connect to a database and they are
quick and responsive. I have yet to have any static site ever hacked and I plan
to keep it that way. But that deserves and post of its own. Maybe next time.
