My name is Zach Dyer and I live in the suburbs of Springfield, Missouri in Ozark.
Married to my wife, Kris, we have one son named Jacob.

I started web design and programming in 2009 when I met David Hairabedian.
David was a web marketer for a web company called Pheonix Web. When the company
shut down there were a few website projects in limbo that had not been completed
yet. David hired me to finish the projects and he like my work so much he continued
to bring more clients to me from Kansas City.

Building static sites using basic tools such as html, css, and JavaScript I started small.
Then started using PHP to help maintain bigger sites. Then came WordPress.
It was all the hype at that time and so I started doing WordPress sites. Before I
knew it WordPress was everywhere. And eventually WordPress became a security risk.
Now I use a more secure way of building sites with a system that the client has access
to. Clients can see the code and the changes and get a record of all the changes
that are made to the site. New sites are 100% secure and are hosted using GitHub.

I have quite a few clients who keep me busy with maintenance and security for
existing WordPress sites.
